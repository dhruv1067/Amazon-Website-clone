# ðŸ›’ Amazon Website Clone

This is a responsive **Amazon Clone Website** built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It replicates the visual design of Amazon's homepage, including the navigation bar, hero section, product listings, and footer. This project was a great practice to improve my front-end development skills.
